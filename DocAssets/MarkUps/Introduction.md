## Introduction
In order to serve the emerging needs of merchants, OmnyPay has developed a SaaS based white label Contextual Commerce platform with which merchants, banks and service providers will be able to offer their consumers, several unique digital commerce services, as part of their own branded mobile app – thus giving the merchants, full control of their consumer relationships, consumer data and consumer experiences when shopping across their multi-channels environments. Equally, working with partner’s bank’s app, merchants can have a “virtual” relationship with non-frequent customers as well.
The OmnyPay SaaS platform offers a cutting edge orchestration layer which allows the rapid integration of its platform to the merchants’ POS, CRM, Loyalty, marketing, inventory, analytics, and payments, while also enabling a unique core set of premium digital services as part of the Merchants’ own branded app for their repeat customers, and their partners app for less frequently visiting customers.

Consumers identify with the brands that they interact with the most, and have built inherent loyalty with them. The OmnyPay white label solution leverages and strengthens the ongoing brand equity built by the merchant or bank or service provider throughout the ongoing relationship with their loyal shoppers, and by consistently promoting it across all channels.  Through its mobile SDK and Open APIs, the OmnyPay platform can be quickly integrated with the existing mobile apps, as well as, with their legacy POS and backend systems.
